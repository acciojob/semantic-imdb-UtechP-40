            <p>
                "Inception" is a science fiction thriller directed by Christopher Nolan. The film follows Dom Cobb, a skilled thief who is an expert in the art of extracting valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state. His abilities have made him a coveted player in industrial espionage, but they have also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he loves. Cobb is offered a chance to have his past erased if he can implant an idea into someone's mind, a task known as "inception." As he assembles a team for the job, they embark on a mind-bending journey through layers of dreams.
